                            <p>OSHA has established federal regulations regarding the "control of energy sources" in manufacturing. These regulations require energy shutoff devices to be installed on pneumatically powered equipment. L-O-X valves have been manufactured for more than 30 years. They are the most specified valve of their kind throughout the world, and they provide an immediate shutoff of system air supply. ROSS also offers a combination unit of the L-O-X valve and the EEZ-ON valve. The L-O-X/EEZ-ON valves provides the features of both the individual valve, but in one body. For more information, click the L-O-X/EEZ-ON valve.</p>

                            <p>EEZ-ON Valves gently turn on air for pneumatic circuits. When compressed air is initially applied to a pneumatic circuit, the working parts may move suddenly, potentially causing machine damage or injury to employees. The EEZ-ON valve provides a gradual startup by allowing a gradual and adjustable increase in downstream pressure.</p>

                    text="Check valves allow full flow through a pneumatic circuit, but in only one direction. They are ideal for applications in which reverse flow of air pressure is unnecessary or detrimental. Pilot-operated check valves operate like regular check valves. The flow in only one direction, but when the pilot is actuated, the check valve is forced open so flow can go both ways. The pilot-operated check valve can stop a cylinder in any position."

Flow control valves allow air flow to go in both directions. In one direction, flow is at full speed. In the other direction, flow is metered. By managing the air flow out of the cylinder, a flow control valve controls the speed of the cylinder. Cylinder speed determines the speed of work processes."
